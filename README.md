# Multinomial-Modeling-and-Post-stratification-of-2021-Canadian-Vote-Choice
This research project estimates national support for the three major Canadian federal parties: Liberal, Conservative, and NDP, by combining 2021 Canadian Election Study survey data with 2021 Census information. To address sampling biases where certain groups are over or underrepresented in surveys, the study utilizes multinomial logistic regression to model individual vote choice based on eight sociodemographic variables and applies post-stratification to weight these predictions according to the true population structure of Canada. The analysis identifies age, religion, and province as particularly strong predictors of partisan preference, ultimately producing a national popular vote estimate that closely mirrors the actual 2021 election results. Specifically, the model predicted a remarkably narrow race with the Liberal Party at 37.55% and the Conservative Party at 37.47%, demonstrating that demographic factors and sound statistical methods can effectively capture complex national voting patterns.
